Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with Clay, try these steps:

- Refresh your browser and check your internet connection.
- Ensure your integrations are properly connected and authenticated.
- Check if your data source (e.g., Google Sheets, Salesforce) is accessible and permissions are set correctly.
- For failed enrichments, review error messages in the table for details.
- If you encounter rate limits or API errors, try again later or check with your provider.

Common Problems:
- Table wonâ€™t load: Try clearing browser cache or use an incognito window.
- Data not updating: Make sure automations and integrations are enabled.
- Error messages: Hover over errors in your table for more info.

If issues persist, use the in-app chat bubble to contact Clay support or visit the documentation for further assistance.
