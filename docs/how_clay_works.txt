How Clay Works

Clay lets you create visual, no-code workflows called Tables. Each Table represents a process for gathering, enriching, and exporting data.

Workflow Steps:
1. Import data from sources like LinkedIn, Apollo, Google Sheets, Salesforce, or by uploading a CSV.
2. Add enrichment steps to automatically find more data, like emails, company info, or social profiles, using built-in integrations.
3. Use filters, lookups, and conditional logic to customize your workflow.
4. Automate actions like sending results to your CRM, email, or Slack.
5. Collaborate in real time with your team, sharing tables and automations.

Each step in your Table can use data from previous steps, allowing you to build powerful, multi-stage research or outbound processes.

Clay is flexible and can be customized for prospecting, lead enrichment, research, and more.
